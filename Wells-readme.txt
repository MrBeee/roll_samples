NOTE for using WELL BASED seeds

At the moment the well files are using absolute paths. 
In the near future this will change to relative paths.

But as a consequence, the *.roll project files will point to non-existing well locations
For example: D:\Roll\PNA-GT-01.well

You'll need to update these locations manually in the property pane to correct locations.
Sorry for the inconvenience caused.

NOTE well files are available in the "wells" subdirectory using two types:
 *.well	OpendTect (x, y, z) format
 *.wws	GeoPath (ahd, inc, azi) format

Please use a text editor to review the contents of these ascii files for which two formats are currently supported.
